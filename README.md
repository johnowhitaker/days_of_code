# Days Of Code
> A '100 days of code' style learning project


The goal here is to write small bits of code every weekday. I'm going to try and keep everything in Jupyter notebooks so that I can use NBDev to manage documenting it all and sharing code between days in case I want to build more complex things using building blocks from previous days. It should also make everything into a nice website at https://johnowhitaker.github.io/days_of_code/.

Here's a demo function defined in another notebook:

```python
demo_code() # Code defined in 00_core.ipynb, exported to 'core.py' and imported at the top of this NB
```




    'demo'



Code from multiple notebooks can go into the same eventual file. Here's a function from 01_Cairo_Hello.ipynb that does a bit of text with cairo and also gets exported to core.py

```python
hw_cairo('this should work')
```

Today is a Saturday - but I'm keen to get started and at least lay the foundation so that on Monday I can jump right in rather than starting with all the setup (although it was nice and easy thanks to NBDev - thanks team!)
